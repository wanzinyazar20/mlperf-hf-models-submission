# mlperf-hf-models-submission

This script downloads huggingface models and uses [MLCommons rules and methology](https://github.com/mlcommons/) to benchmark the models.

Under the hood, it is using [mlcommon/mlperf loadgen](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/master/loadgen) as orchestrator.
